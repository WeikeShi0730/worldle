# WORLDLE

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Introduction

This is like "Wordle", but it's the geography theme, where you are given 6 chances to guess the name of the country in the outline shape and the flag of the country. It also gives a hint each time for the distance and direction between your guessed country and the answer.

This project is inspired by [WOR'L'DLE](https://worldle.teuteuf.fr/).

## Dev

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
