# WORLDLE

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Introduction

This is like "Wordle", but it's the geography theme, where you are given 6 chances to guess the name of the country in the outline shape and the flag of the country. It also gives a hint each time for the distance and direction between your guessed country and the answer. Detailed instructions and examples can be found on the website.

In settings, users can choose units for distance (miles or kilometers), and choose to toggle to view the flags, which helps to guess the country.

There will be a statistics panel for users to view their overall records.

Users are able to copy their everyday result to the clipboard to share on social media!

Links to the country's wikipedia and Google Maps are provided when completing today's challenge.

This project is inspired by [WOR'L'DLE](https://worldle.teuteuf.fr/).
